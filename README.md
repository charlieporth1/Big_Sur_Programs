# Big Sur Programs 
This script git repo is meant for macOS Big Sur and above (11.0+|OSX).
The main reason I created this repo was because of the filesystem "fixes" apple created that caused more issues than I wanted
The reason apple created the filesystem changes is to prevent tampering of "Apple's "perfect" os". Or for you non techies to prevent system modifications. 
Apples main reason for doing this now it because of macOS 10.15 introduction of SideCar; which for people who have Mac hardware from 2015 or ealier (Non Touch Bar hardware) didn't get this feature; and people found a way to patch SideCar
for example [SidecarPatcher](https://github.com/pookjw/SidecarPatcher) or [free-sidecar](https://github.com/ben-z/free-sidecar)
I was one of the people who got around it
I created this to reallow that
Apple no longer allows "Filesystem streaming" so you will have to apply updates and reboot 
I also create a recovery disk instation script because I didn't have one at the time
